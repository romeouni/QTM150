#### _This material is built upon your understanding of the Introduction to R tutorial you completed on DataCamp. You may also use this rmd file as a template for your future assignments that need to be completed using an rmd file._


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Importing data and saving data
```{r, results='hide'}
# Always save datasets and rmd files in your working directory!
getwd() # be sure to check your own working directory!
gss<-read.csv("gss.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)  # import dataset and assign it in gss
dim(gss) # dataframe contains 53474 rows and 14 variables
set.seed(1234) # generating a random number sequence

#Create a small dataset by randomly sampling 100 observations from gss
nrow(gss) #show the total number of rows in gss
sample(nrow(gss), 100) #randomly select 100 row numbers
gss100<-gss[sample(nrow(gss),100),] # assign 100 observations into an object called gss100
dim(gss100) # make sure 100 observations are assigned in gss100
?sample # learn more about how to use sample function
```

You can also create a new dataset and save it as a file into your working directory. Use the following template.   
*write.csv(dataset, "name.csv")*  

```{r}
write.csv(gss100, "smallgss.csv") #save it in your working directory!
```

## 2. Observing data 
```{r}
dim(gss100) #the number of observations and variables
names(gss100) #variable names
str(gss100) #structure of dataset
summary(gss100) #summary of each variable
head(gss100)  #print the first six observations
tail(gss100, 10) #print the last 10 observations
is.na(gss100$income)
sum(is.na(gss100$income)) #print a total number of missing values in the income variable
sum(is.na(gss$income)) #print a total number of missing values in the income variable in the original dataset
?is.na #learn more about is.na function
```


## 3. Extracting parts
dataframe is a matrix, each variable (column) is a vector

```{r}
#dataset[row, column]
gss100[1,2]

# dataset[rows, columns]
gss100[1:5, c(2,5)] 


#dataset$variable, the whole column
gss100[,7]
gss100$marital

# dataset$variable[rows]
gss100$marital[1:10]
```

## 4. Basic plots: 

See R reference card:   
- one variable: histogram  
- one categorical: barplot(categorical)  
- two variables: scatterplot(two quant), side-by-side boxplot(quant vs cat)

```{r}
# one quantitative variable: 
hist(gss100$age)
mean(gss100$age)
sd(gss100$age)

# one categorical variable:
# barplot(frequency table)
table(gss100$marital)
barplot(table(gss100$marital))

# one quantitative vs one categorical
boxplot(gss100$age~gss100$sex)

# two quantitative variables
# plot(x,y)
```

## 5. Vectors
Almost everything in R is a vector.  All elements(values) of a vector must be of the same type.

```{r}
# str() can tell us 
str(gss100)
```


There are four types of atomic vectors in R.

### 1) NUMERIC VECTOR (integer and Double)

A numeric vector is a list of numbers. Integer and double vectors are known collectively as numeric vectors. (Doubles represent floating point numbers that can not always be precisely represented with a fixed amount of memory.)

The *c()* function is used to collect things together into a vector. The output is 

```{r}
c(1,2,3)
# We can save this to a named object:
x<-c(1:10)  # The : sybmbol used to create a sequence of increasing (or decreasing) values
x
y<-c(30:1)
y


# use the square bracket to extract the element(value)
x[5] 
x[c(1,3,5)]

x[3:7]
x[-c(1,3,5,7,9)]
```


#### *seq(), rep(), sample()*

There are simple patterned numeric vectors can also be produced using the *seq()* function, the *rep()* function, and the *sample()* function.
```{r}
# seq(start, end, by=1)
seq(0,100,by=5) # the sequence of numbers from 0 to 100 with the increment is 5

# rep(x, times of repetition)
rep(2,5)    # repeat the value 2, 5 times

x<-c(1:5)
rep(x,2)  # repeat x twice

y<-c(10:15)
rep(c(x,y),2)  # repeat x and y, twice

# take a random sample, we can use sample() function. 

# sample(vector, sample size, replace=T/F)

set.seed(1234)
sample(1:30, 5, replace=TRUE) 

# randomly choose 5 numbers from 1 to 30 with replacement
# set.seed() is used to fix the starting point to get a random sample, make sure to get the same sample when the code is executed each time

```


#### Numeric vector arithmetic
Arithmetic can be done on R vectors. Note that the computation is performed *elementwise*.

```{r, results='hide'}
## Be sure to check all the results by doing it yourself!
x<-c(1:5)
x*2
x^2
7 %% 2  # the modular operator, the remainder of the division of 7 by 2.
7 %/% 2 

x %% 2 # odd number and even number

y<-c(6:10)

x+y  # the same length
y-x 
```

The operation functions in R can be done on numeric vectors as well.

```{r, results='hide'}
## Again, be sure to check all the results by doing it yourself!
x
sum(x)
mean(x)
length(x)
avg_x<-sum(x)/length(x)
avg_x
```

Example 1:

```{r}
a<-c(1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 20, 19, 10)
# check odd numbers:
sum(a%%2) # Think about how this operation gives you the correct output of the number of odd observations in this vector
```


### 2) CHARACTER VECTOR

Vectors can be made up of strings of characters instead of numbers. 

```{r}
schoolyear<-c("Freshman","Sophomore","Junior","Senior")

schoolyear

x<-c(2,4, 3,1)
 
# give the names to the numeric vector with the character vector
names(x)<-schoolyear
x
```

#### *substr() and paste()*

There are two basic operations you might want to perform on character vectors. 

The *substr()* funcion takes subtrings, it takes arguments 
*substr(x, start, stop)*, where x is a vector of characters(strings), and *start* and *stop* say which chacarters to keep. 

The other basis operation is building up strings by concatenation. Use the *paste()* function for this.

*tolower()* and *toupper()* are functions to convert upper case and lower case.

```{r}
substr(schoolyear,1,2)


scoolyear1<-paste(schoolyear,"Year")

paste("The",schoolyear,"Year", sep=" ")

tolower(schoolyear)
```

Example 2:
```{r}
substr(state.name, 1, 1)
# translate all the state names to lower case
tolower(state.name)
```


### 3) LOGICAL VECTOR

R also supports **logical** vectors, where the values are either *TRUE* or *FALSE*. It is often necessary to test relations when programming. R allows testing of equality and inequality relations using the relational operators: 

1. greater than: $>$, 
2. less than: $<$, 
3. equality: $==$, 
4. inequality: $!=$, $>=$, $<=$, 
5. matching: $ %in% $. 

For example, we can ask 

```{r}
x<-c(1:5)
x>3
3==4

schoolyear %in% "Senior"

```

With a logical data result, *TRUE* has an internal value of 1 and FALSE has an internal value of 0.  Summing a logical will evaluate the total number of *TRUE* results.

```{r}
sum(x>3)
```

The logical (boolean) operation is very helpful to extract subsets by *subset(logical expression)* 

```{r}
gss100subset<-gss100[gss100$year==2010,]
head(gss100subset)
names(gss100subset)

state.name[substr(state.name,1,1)=="N"]
schoolyear[substr(schoolyear,1,1)=="S"]
```

The logical operators are very useful to get a subset. 
```{r}
# subset(data/vector, logical expression)
```

#### Boolean operation
The Boolean operations can be encoded in R. $\&$ and $|$ mean *and* and *or*, $!$ means negative. These operations are very important to make a subset.
```{r}
x<-c(1:20)

x1<-subset(x, (x>10) & (x==12))
x1

x2<-subset(x, (x<=5) | (x>14))
x2

gss2<-gss[gss$year==2010, ]

```

#### *is.XXX()* 
##### *is.na()* and *!is.na()* is used to detect the missing values in the dataset
```{r}

sum(is.na(gss$marital))
sum(is.na(gss$region))
sum(is.na(gss$age))

sum(is.na(gss$age[gss$region=="SOUTH ATLANTIC"]))

# the missing values
mean(gss$age[gss$region=="SOUTH ATLANTIC"], na.rm = TRUE)

```
##### *is.vectortype()* is used to check the type of the vector.
```{r}
is.character(state.name)
is.numeric(gss$age)
is.character(gss$marital)
str(gss)
```


### 4) FACTOR
The factors are used to store categorical variables with numeric data. labels + numbers. *factor()* is used to create a new factor. *is.XXX()* and *class()* are used to check specific type, *as.XXX()* is used to cast vectors to specific type.

```{r}
str(gss)
levels(gss$region) # a factor has its own levels, labels + numbers

schoolyear<-c("Freshman","Sophomore","Freshman","Sophomore","Senior","Freshman","Sophomore","Junior")
class(schoolyear)
is.factor(schoolyear)
factor(schoolyear)
is.factor(schoolyear)

schoolyear_factor<-as.factor(schoolyear)
is.factor(schoolyear_factor)

levels(schoolyear_factor)  # alphabetical order by default

schoolyear_number<-as.numeric(schoolyear_factor)
schoolyear_number

table(schoolyear)   # categorical variable is summarized by frequency table
barplot(table(schoolyear)) # barplot(frequency table)
barplot(table(schoolyear_factor))
```

#### Reorder the levels of the factor. 

The original factor order is alphabetical. You can change ordering of the levels:
```{r}
# change ordering of the levels
# vector<-factor(vector, levels=c("level1","level2","level3"))

schoolyear_factor<-factor(schoolyear, levels = c("Freshman","Sophomore","Junior","Senior"))

levels(schoolyear_factor)

barplot(table(schoolyear_factor))
```


#### Recode a factor / Re-assign levels to a factor 

Change values of a factor to NA
```{r}
levels(gss$happy)
# creating a new variable by copying the original one, making changes on the new one, 
# so that we don't change the orginial data

# create a new factor
# new vector<-factor(vector, levels=c("level1","level2","level3"))

gss$happy1<-factor(gss$happy,levels=c("NOT TOO HAPPY","PRETTY HAPPY", "VERY HAPPY"))

gss$happy1[gss$happy=="NOT TOO HAPPY"]<-"NOT TOO HAPPY"

gss$happy1[gss$happy=="PRETTY HAPPY"]<-"PRETTY HAPPY"

gss$happy1[gss$happy=="VERY HAPPY"]<-"VERY HAPPY"

gss$happy1[gss$happy==" " | gss$happy=="DK"]<-NA

levels(gss$happy1)

barplot(table(gss$happy))
barplot(table(gss$happy1))
```

#### Create a binary factor (shortcut *ifelse()*)
```{r}
gss$happy2<-factor(ifelse(gss$happy=="VERY HAPPY","HAPPY","NOT HAPPY"))

summary(gss$happy)
summary(gss$happy2)

```
